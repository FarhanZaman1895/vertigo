# Vertigo

Y is this so weird

## Description

This project is a compiler for my esoteric language vertigo. This language is not meant to be usable it's just a fun project to see if I can parse and compile a language like this. What is the language you may be asking? Well let me show you how to write hello world (Currently a work in progress)

```
"p
hr
ei
ln
lt
o;

w
o
r
l
d
!
"
;
```

Yes it's that painful.
For more information, read Docs.md

# Compilation

The program currently compiles to python, tho there are plans to make my own virtual machine for the language, but that will come at a later date

To compile it's simply the command `vertigo <input.vt> <output.py>`
